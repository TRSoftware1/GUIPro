# GUIPro
## The ultimate solution to creating custom GUIs entirely in-game!

## Overview
GUIPro is a free open-source plugin that allows administrators of Minecraft servers to create their own custom GUIs using only in-game functionality. There is no need to use the YAML to set the GUIs up. These GUIs can be accessed via custom commands and they are also accessible via API endpoints.

The goal of the plugin is to make it so that server admins can create complex GUIs full of customization with ease.
